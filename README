This is a collection of utilities and configuration files for my 
(now defunct) MythTV setup. 

Since the digital transition and HD came along I haven't been
interested in making the changes necessary to keep my PVR solution
up and running. Among other issues (too much space consumed by HD, IR 
blaster setup needed, old and noisy computer), I really don't watch
enough TV to warrant a PVR anymore. Despite this I find it hard to
trash all of my effort in setting it up to work just right. Rather than
toss them into the bit garbage disposal, I'm releasing them here. I hope
you find something useful!
